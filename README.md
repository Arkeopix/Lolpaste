# LolPaste

What is this ?
* Lolpaste is a small paste utility.
* Each paste has a lifetime of 24 hours.
* You can use it using the command line utility...
* ... Or the the web interface

it because it was lame and unfinished. It is still lame, but finished, i guess.  

Here is a short demo:
